# Predicting Trip Purpose Based on Spatial, Temporal, and Personal Features

My Summer 2018 project while working as a Data Science Research Intern at Missouri University of Science & Technology

I took CalTrans Big Data (450k trips each with 50 features) on trips and created a new predictive models that surpassed previous optimized models by 4%
by weighting long-term vs short-term behavior.

My Tasks Included
- Cleansing the data to make it usable
- Creating Data Visualizations to better understand the data
- Training and Testing the data on standard models (linear/logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting Trees, Random Forest Classifier)
- Optimizing these standard models by doing Feature Selection and Feature Engineering
- Developing a new, novel predictive model that weighted long-term and short-term behavior differently
